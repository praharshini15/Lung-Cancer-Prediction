# Lung-Cancer-Prediction with AI-Powered Insights
Developed a Deep learning model that predicts lung answer and provides the explanation using API key

This project is a Streamlit web application that classifies lung CT scan images into categories (Benign, Malignant, Normal) using a deep learning model.  
It also integrates OpenAI GPT to provide simple, non-medical-expert explanations of the predicted diagnosis, including what it means, possible causes, precautions, treatments, and when to seek urgent care.

 Features
- Upload CT scan images for classification  
- Deep learning model (ResNet / VGG preprocessing) for predictions  
- Displays class label with prediction confidence  
- AI-generated medical insights in plain language (using OpenAI GPT)  
- Clean and interactive **Streamlit** interface
